"* Includes only children who reside with at least one parent. The term ""immigrants"" refers to people residing in the United States who were not U.S. citizens at birth. This population includes naturalized citizens, lawful permanent residents (LPRs), certain legal nonimmigrants (e.g., persons on student or work visas), those admitted under refugee or asylee status, and persons illegally residing in the United States. Immigrant families are defined as families with at least one immigrant parent.",,,,,,,,
"**In the 2013 ACS, the Census Bureau includes children of same-sex married couples in the overall total number of children, but the same information is unavailable by parental nativity. This means that the sum of children of natives and children of immigrants may be smaller than the total number of children.",,,,,,,,
