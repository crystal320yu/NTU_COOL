"* The data here include only children (regardless of their nativity) who reside with at least one parent. The term ""children of immigrants"" (or children in immigrant families) refers to children under 18 with at least one immigrant parent. The term ""immigrants"" refers to people residing in the United States who were not U.S. citizens at birth. This population includes naturalized citizens, lawful permanent residents (LPRs), certain legal nonimmigrants (e.g., persons on student or work visas), those admitted under refugee or asylee status, and persons illegally residing in the United States. 

Beginning with the 2014 ACS, the U.S. Census Bureau excludes children of same-sex married couples from the total number of children; the same information is unavailable by parental nativity. This means that the total number of children may be smaller than in previous years.",,,,,,,,
